# The Three Laws of Robotics
# 1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, 
#    allow a human being to come to harm.
# 2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except 
#    where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
# 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such 
#    protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
